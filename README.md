        Webapp connected to a discord bot (DanuBot)

!! Before starting the server, don't forget to start a database :)
!! 'npm start' on project level

--> Using the WEBAPP <--

1. Navigate to: localhost:3000
2. 'Avaible Databases' lets you manage the avaible databases
    2.a. You can choose between Dogs and Users.
        2.a.a. CRUD methods can be done on Dogs database.
        2.a.b. You can register a new user only in the user database. Attention!: It has to match your discord username.
3. 'DanuBot' option can be used to send 'announcements' (messages) to Danubius discord server.

--> Using the Discord platform (with messages) <--

1. Join the discord server:
    Discord invite link: https://discord.gg/amTgUEuy7F
2. After you registered your discord username on the webapp, please type '!reg' in the 'danubot-commands' channel to register. You should also get a discord role and a confirmation from DanuBot.
3. Type '!help' for useful commands.
4. For more commands you should type '!op' first (this way DanuBot grants you developer permission). Try out '!createedog [origin] [description -can be as long as you want-]" for example!
